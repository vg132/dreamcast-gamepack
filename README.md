Dreamcast GamePack 1

Unfinished Dreamcast game that would be a collection of multiple mini games. I think I only "finished" Minesweeper but I don't remember the state of any of the game, it's been over 15 years since I worked on this. Uses the Dreamcast Common framework, https://github.com/vg132/dreamcast-common/ and is build on KOS 1.2.0, https://github.com/ljsebald/KallistiOS
